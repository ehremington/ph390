    "## Day 6\n",

    "Now that we have talked through the major operators in python, we need to put this altogether with the python function. Functions in python are small packages of code that can take in input and execute a series of steps based on that input, and optionally return an output. Functions are defined beginning with `def` statements so something like this:\n",
    "``` \n",
    "def myFunction(inputs go here if necessary):\n",
    "    print('this is a function')\n",
    "    return 'now i'm done'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can write functions that can perform a particular calculation with different inputs, and we can begin to keep some of these so we can refer to them again later. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wrote a couple of functions in class, one for calculating factorials and another for understanding spherical coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we need to get to our first new kind of operations in python, `if`, `while`, and `for`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` is a conditional statement, that is if some kind of condition is met, then it will execute a block of code that is underneath it. If that condition is not met, then it won't. You can see how I use if/then statements in that last sentence, and that is basically how python works too. The `then` part of this command is what is executed inside of the `if` statement. IF that condition is not met, then a couple of things can be coded in to happening. Either nothing happens and the program continues with the next command that is issued, or you can put a `else` or `elif` commands and issue another set of instructions for the program to follow in the event that the `if` statement is not true. This true/false property gives us yet another data structure that we have not seen yet: the Boolean. It does not come up as a data type in its own right very often, but it is necessary to control `if` or `while` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a `while` statement is a `for` loop. A `for` loop iterates over an input, and performs a function that is included within it. `for` and `while` loops can often be used interchangeably, but I find myself usually going to a `for` loop more often. The iterator can be many things, but we will start with base python `range` function and then also use numpy's functions `np.arange` and `np.linspace`. Much of what we do will be using `for` loops although there are some faster ways of doing things using a numpy array that will speed things up. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in class we wrote a `while` statement that printed the Fibonacci numbers up to 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "For homework, I want you to write a program that performs a sum of reciprocals. In mathematical language this would look like $s(k) = \\sum_1^{100} \\frac{1}{k}$. As a check on this, you should get about 5.187. I would use a `for` loop on this. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Day 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will finish our discussion of data types, by talking about strings and talking about lists or arrays. We have already used strings to print statements in words to the terminal. They are an important class of data, but less used in physics simulations. However the most important data structure to us is the list, and the important upgrade to the array. We will learn to create and import a list, how to print it and will begin to see how to graph it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A string is any kind of data stored between single quotes, such as `'Hello World'`. A string can contain numbers, but they are not stored or used as numbers but rather essentially as letters. If a number happens to be stored as a string and you would like to use it as a number, then you can use the `float` or `int` functions for this. There are a few other properties of strings that we can talk about once we get through the next section on *lists*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a collection of data structures, and while technically anything can go in the container, we will be dealing with lists mostly as a collection of float numbers. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Day 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have Python installed, we need to add a few packages that will help us do more math without having to code everything ourselves. So we need to use conda to install numpy, matplotlib, and pandas at least. Before we get started using these, we should go over how to import them. In this class, we will import using `import numpy as np`. This has a few advantages over some alternatives. It may be slower than absolutely necessary, but it is tolerable for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to investigate some of the basic features and functions of any programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used a variable in Day 2, but a variable is simply a name or letter that stores a reference to another object in python. I have to _declare_ a variable in order to use it, and in python that means I have to give it a value (even if it won't keep that value). `x` vs `x=5` vs `x=y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, python is very limited in the math that it can do for you. `x = 5*10` works just fine but `x=y/2` does not nor can python solve for another variable like `y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "But something like `x = x + 1` works just fine (as long as x has been defined already), even though it makes no sense to us. In fact, we will do operations like this all the time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a few examples (and we'll cover comments along the way):\n",
    "1. a ball dropped from a tower, given a height and time, tell where the ball is.\n",
    "2. conversion from polar coordinates to cartesian\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you do some extensions of these:\n",
    "1. From the ball dropped example, write a program that calculates the time it takes to hit the ground from a tower of any height.\n",
    "\n",

    "Talk about OpenAI. I told students they could use it, but that they should tell me every time when they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go through the python versions of 1. PowerShell/Terminal 2. Script 3. Jupyter Notebook/Lab. We did a very simple 'hello world' as well well as a for loop just to show the differences in each, and went over some typo level gotcha's that come up. Ended on Jupyter Lab and showed them how that is a nice mid point between the interpreter and a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the interpreter, they should just use terminal on Mac/Linux, and use Powershell for Anaconda on Windows. I spent some time on my powershell getting it to work for me by default, but students don't need to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the script, I had them use `#!/usr/bin/env python` for the shebang in the first line and this worked for everyone without a problem, though I wasn't sure if it would. We looked at mistakes and I showed them how to use the Traceback to kind of find where the problem is, although this is not perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For jupyter, we only launched `lab` but this is fine because it what I use  most of the time now anyway. \n",

    "Talk through the motivations for this class and how to get set up to begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivations:\n",
    "1. We want you to learn to code because it is important in its own right\n",
    "2. We want you to learn how to think about math from a different perspective and you will learn it more effectively\n",
    "3. We want you to learn some specific algorithms and how to implement them\n",
    "4. We want you to become comfortable using a computer and getting the most out of it\n",
    "\n",
    "How to get started. Software you need to have installed:\n",
    "1. Anaconda Python\n",
    "2. Mathematica (mathlm.samford.edu)\n",
    "3. Dropbox (log in and download)\n",
    "4. Overleaf (just a log in)\n",
    "5. Keepassxc (on computer)\n",
